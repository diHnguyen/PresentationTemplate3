# OR Presentation Template 3 (Clemson Purple)

A special thanks to Murwan Siddig for sharing this template.

In this template, you can expect to find the code for:
- Showing a slide in multiple stages with the ability to specify which information is shown on the 1st or 2nd (or as many as needed)
- A different look for theorems and definitions 
- A quick way to create slide "animation" if most of the content on the slide remains the same
- An example of a large table computational results (with some columns and rows merged)
- How to hide a slide without deleting the content (search for keyword: \exclude)
